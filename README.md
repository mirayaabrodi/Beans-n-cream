# Beans'n Cream :coffee:

A website about a cafeteria called "Beans'n Cream", which show-cases their work, shows the products they sell and their blog posts. :tada:

## The Background Behind This Project :open_book:

The idea behind this project is that almost every programmer loves to drink coffee, so I thought to myself why not make a website about a cafeteria with lots of different good coffees. :blush:

## What I learned :brain:

- Heavily focused on creating lots of different transitions and working with the `transform` property.
